# Aquarium Management Database
Created by Krystal Wong, Mea Srisan, and Jacob Lacsamana.

This database models a mini aquarium system.

The user of this system would be an employee of the aquarium. This system would allow them to keep track of each animal in the aquarium, 
their feeding schedules and which enclosure they are in. It allows the user to add and update the employees working at the aquarium and their 
assigned jobs (i.e. what feeding or cleaning schedule they are in charge of, or what event they are leading at the aquarium), as well as keep track of the
animal health checkups conducted by biologists working at the aquarium. This system also allows for the user to see and update what events are being put on 
at the aquarium, including events specifically booked by a customer, and which animals and staff are participating in those events.
